Purpose: To take a step back from learning with React, to improve my vanilla coding skills, as some challenges were proving too time consuming to validate working on them further. This project will contain a lightbox, a css grid, and notes about the purpose of my code and the expected time frame for this project is about two weeks. 

Once this project is complete rebuild it as a React project for further practice.
