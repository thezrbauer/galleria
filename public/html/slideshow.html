           <div class="artist-bio"> Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor 
            studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. 
            The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a 
            view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including 
            The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, 
            around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the 
            morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."<br><br><br>
